      - Make Dry Rub and Chicken Wings
      - Preheat oven to 400 F degrees.  Line a large baking sheet with 2 sheets of aluminum foil (or 1 heavy duty sheet).  Top that with an oven safe cooling rack and spray it with non-stick cooking spray and set aside.
      - Combine all dry rub ingredients in a small mixing bowl, set aside.  In a large mixing bowl, add chicken wings and vegetable oil.  Use a rubber spatula to toss genly to coat.
      - Sprinkle in about half to 2/3 of the dry rub mixture and use your hands to massage it into all of the chicken wings, coating evenly.  Feel free to use all the dry rub, but for a coating like in the photos, 1/2-2/3 of the mixture does just fine.
      - Add chicken wings to prepared baking sheet and bake for 45 minutes.
      - Make Gorgonzola Sauce
      - To your food processor or blender, add mayo, buttermilk, sour cream, and 1.5 oz of the gorgonzola cheese, garlic, lemon jice, pepper, and salt.  Process until smooth.
      - Transfer to serving bowl and stir in remaining gorgonzola cheese.  Cover with plastic wrap and refridgerate until ready to serve.
      - Serve with carrot sticks and celery
